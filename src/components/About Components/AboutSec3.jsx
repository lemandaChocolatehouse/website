            I, Anuradha Chauhan, am a TGT Science teacher turned chocolatier and
            Baker. This sentence in itself is an explanation of a lot of my
            struggles. Thanks to COVID-19 I lost a well-paying job at Baba
            Kadera Singh Boarding School in Akha Sonkh, Goverdhan, Mathura in
            2020 which made me feel at my lowest during that period, affirming
            one specific thought "I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE" but I still had
            responsibilities to look after
            {isExpanded && (
              <>
                Therefore, I made my love for cooking a little handy and started
                my small business of chocolates and cookies. When I started I
                didn't have a big capital or experience, but, the idea was
                enough for me to dream my biggest dream of entering the
                chocolate and baking industry, and without giving a thought to a
                small capital I started my business at a local level. <br />
                When I started marketing at a regional level people started
                acquiring a taste of what I had to offer which was a pleasure to
                think of and a motivation to live upon. However, my lack of
                knowledge of the business made me go through some setbacks which
                caused some losses as well and I started picking it up as a
                lesson, but, a smart person should not learn their lessons
                through losses every time they run a progressive business.
                Hence, I joined NIESBUD. <br />
                <br />
                I joined NIESBUD cookery and bakery classes dt. MAY' 2023 -
                JULY' 2023, these classes did not only offer cooking and baking,
                but also, advised us on how to run a business by managing the
                market, the customer, packaging, finance, etc. Through NIESBUD I
                got registered for MSME, as well as, it gave me an opportunity
                to present my business at National Education Programme, 2023
                organised at PRAGATI MAIDAN which proved to be a learning
                experience for me and a betterment for my business in the long
                run. Not to forget, my happiness of attending the Prime
                Minister's speech. And here, ends my journey with NIESBUD.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />I acknowledge this with gratitude towards Director Poonam
                Sinha and all the NIESBUD staff members who helped me grow and
                understand entrepreneurship in the best way possible.
